dear diary, 

two fridays ago, i lost a pack of cigarettes. this sort of thing shouldnt bother me for two main reasons. one: health concerns. two: i dont usually smoke cigarettes. however, i paid for them [twelve fucking dollars in nyc], and i was very drunk, so i fostered a certain predisposition towards chainsmoking. there was about half a pack left, and possibly about half a night left. i guess if im asking why i lost them, i do know why; i was keeping them in my back pocket for comfort, but i never keep anything in my back pocket. it confirmed my suspicions; the back pocket is useless, and not only deforms whatever you keep in there, it sometimes loses them completely. besides that, the only things ive felt comfortable holding in a back pocket is those postcards you get that restaraunts are starting to give out with the chit. i dont know why thats the new trend now, because no one uses postcards. although i guess i answer that myself as well, ive kept them all and will most likely put them on my fridge. since i lost my cigarettes, i have not gone to buy another- see earlier brackets- so after this rambling, the question arises:

 - BACK POCKET \\\\ force for evil or good?  

because i supposed it helped me with the postcards and got rid of cigarettes for me, while giving me something to laugh at and judge people for when they put their wallet inside it. i guess all in all it's a trap for the foolhardy.
